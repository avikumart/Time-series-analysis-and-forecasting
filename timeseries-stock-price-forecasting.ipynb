that are recorded over a period of time. these observations are dependent of time component which can not be neglected thus we have have to analysis the this data keeping time component in mind.\n","\n","<img src = \"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*j8LjgYr1r1xPrJkr.gif\" width = 900 height = 400/>\n","\n","### **Time Series Forecasting**\n","\n","- Time series forecasting is parhaps one of the most common type of machine learning techniques used in real-world scenarios. `time-sereis forecsting refers to predicting future values from historical data by statical analysis of trends and patterns from certain time-series data.` it falls under unsupervised learning category but called as a self-supervised learning or supervised learning technique. time-series data can be much complex to find patterns out of it, this is because irregular component of time series. \n","\n","## **Use-cases and applications:**\n","- Forecast product demand\n","- Economic growth and population forecasting\n","- Weather forecasting\n","- Stock price forecasting\n","- Sales/Revenue forecasting\n","- Web-traffic forecasting\n","\n","\n","## **Problem-statement**\n","\n","- In this notebook, our problem-statement is to analyse S&P500 stock prices (We will analyze 10 popular stocks and forecast the future prices) and build forecasting models that beat the market.\n","\n","roadmap:
